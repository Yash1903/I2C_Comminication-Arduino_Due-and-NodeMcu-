I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a serial bus interface connection protocol. It is also called as TWI (two-wire interface) since it uses only two wires for communication. Those two wires are SDA (serial data) and SCL (serial clock).  I2C is an acknowledgment-based communication protocol i.e. transmitter checks for an acknowledgment from the receiver after transmitting data to know whether data is received by the receiver successfully.  I2Cworks in two modes namely,  Master mode Slave mode SDA (serial data) wire is used for data exchange between master and slave devices. SCL (serial clock) is used for the synchronous clock in between master and slave devices.  The master device initiates communication with a slave device. The master device requires a slave device address to initiate a conversation with a slave device. The slave device responds to the master device when it is addressed by a master device.  NodeMCU has I2C functionality support on its GPIO pins. Due to internal functionality on ESP-12E, we cannot use all its GPIOs for I2C functionality. So, do tests before using any GPIO for I2C applications.
